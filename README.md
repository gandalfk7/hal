# hal

This is Hal, 
Hal is the dumb cousin of a real smart home system. 
Hal is not Cloud® driven because we believe the Cloud® doens't exist.
Hal tries to be simple and easily customisable.

Hal has some folders:
'''
> -index.php		which is Hal's main file
> 
> -areas			is the folder where are stored the pages you reach clicking on the areas on the images
>    |-area7_external.html
> 
> -config			stores the configuration files
>    |-controls.php	contains the scripts to get the sensor's data
>    |-sensors.php	contains the definition of the sensors and the controls
> 
> -css
>    |-background-image.css	defines some things to make the webpage nice like an otter
> 
> -images
>    |-house_hal01.png		is the main image on which the areas will be defined
